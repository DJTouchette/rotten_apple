===ROTTEN APPLES====

This web app was made as my first rails application. In it you can create a user and post a movie and a description and other users can comment. The front end utilizes bootstrap.



=========More info==========

This project was made to understand and implement the rails workflow. I was fortunate enough to be able to implement bcrypt and use authentication. Along with mailers, and uploaders. There is also a search function implemented that works through sequel injection(which isnt the most secure way), it utilizes flashes if no results are found so no redirection is necessary. This project was a playground sorry for the mess!
